# Python Learning Assignment

This repository contains a series of Python tutorials and exercises aimed at enhancing your understanding of Python programming and its applications in Data Science. The materials include both basic and advanced Python topics, as well as an introduction to the NumPy and Pandas library. Each section is broken down into individual Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts with detailed explanations using Markdown for clarity.

## Structure of the Repository

### 1. [Introduction to Python](https://www.learnpython.org/)
- A brief introduction to Python, covering basic concepts such as variables, data types, loops, functions, and more.
- Completion of exercises on the website linked above.

### 2. [Data Science tutorial](https://www.learnpython.org/en/Numpy_Arrays)
- **File**: `learn-python-2.ipynb`
- **Description**: This notebook contains tutorials on Python for data science, utilizing the `cars.csv` dataset. 


### 3. [Advanced Python Tutorials](https://www.learnpython.org/en/Generators)
- **File**: `learn-python-3.ipynb`
- **Description**: Advanced Python tutorials focusing on more complex topics such as object-oriented programming, decorators, and generators.

### 4. [Python Basics (Sections 1 ~ 10)](https://www.pythontutorial.net/)
- **File**: `python-tutorial-1-10.ipynb`
- **Description**: A detailed exploration of Python basics, covering topics such as variables, conditionals, loops, functions, and data structures (lists, tuples, dictionaries).

### 5. [Python Basics (Section 11)](https://www.pythontutorial.net/python-basics/python-module/)
- **File**: `python-tutorial-11.py`
- **Description**: A Python script focusing on file handling and exception management. It includes examples of reading from and writing to files, along with error handling.

### 6. [Python Basics (Sections 12, 13, and 15)](https://www.pythontutorial.net/python-basics/python-module/)
- **File**: `python-tutorial-12-15.ipynb`
- **Description**: This notebook covers more advanced topics in Python, such as regular expressions, lambda functions, list comprehensions, and working with external modules.

### 7. [Python NumPy Tutorial](https://cs231n.github.io/python-numpy-tutorial/)
- **File**: `numpy-tutorials.ipynb`
- **Description**: This notebook covers the basics of NumPy, including arrays, array slicing, and matrix operations. It also introduces more advanced topics like broadcasting and vectorization, which are critical for efficient numerical computing in Python.

### 8. Jupyter Notebook with VSCode
- All `.ipynb` files are designed to be run in a local environment using Jupyter Notebook with VSCode. Please ensure you have set up the environment accordingly, as **Google Colab is not allowed for this assignment**.

### 9. Documentation with Markdown
- Each notebook contains Markdown cells with headings and explanatory text to provide context and understanding for the code. This helps in navigating through the code and grasping the key concepts covered.

## How to Run the Files

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the files in VSCode, ensuring that you have installed Jupyter and all necessary Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, etc.
3. Run each notebook or Python script, following along with the explanations provided in the Markdown cells.

## Dataset Used
- **cars.csv**: This dataset is used in the data science tutorials for practical hands-on learning with Python libraries.
- **Quotes.txt**: This is text file which is used for read write files 
- **The-zen-of-python.text**: This is text file which is used for read write files 

## Conclusion
By completing these tutorials, you will gain a solid foundation in Python, which is essential for data science and other advanced topics. Each notebook and script is designed to build upon the previous one, progressively increasing in complexity while providing thorough explanations along the way.
